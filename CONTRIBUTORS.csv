# This file is a placeholder to easily audit importance weight for files.
# If not specfied, by default all files are considered equally important.
# The Maintainer reserves the right to attribute importance to files
# in this file, and to change the importance of files at any time.
# Note: It is possible for the same file to share contributors with different importance weights.
# The format is:
# <contributer name>, <file name + path>, <importance weight>
